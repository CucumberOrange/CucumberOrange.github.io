          Welcome to my application for the internship opportunity from HighTechU. My name is Anika and I am a grade 11 student at Mount Douglas Secondary in Saanich, BC.  I have been taking computer science courses since grade 9, and program in Java, C++ and Javascript. I am also a member of the Mount Doug coding club, which is currently preparing to participate in the Waterloo Computing Challenge in February 2021.

          <!-- Question -->
          <h2>Why would you like to work for HighTechU?</h2>
          <p>
            Last summer, I attended HighTechU’s virtual academy. For our team's final project, I coded a fire detection sensor that would sound a warning when the surrounding temperature exceeded 100 degrees Celscius.  I found the experience of working with other like- minded students very enjoyable.  I also thought that HighTechU's approach of bringing together high schoolers, UVic students and professors was innovative and effective. My mentor was particularly helpful and I picked up several new skills in TinkerCAD and using Arduinos. I would, therefore love to come back and work for HighTechU.

        <div class="question3">
          <!-- Question -->
          <h2>What do you hope to get out of the internship?</h2>
          <!-- Answer -->
          <p>
            I hope to get more experience in programming solutions to real life problems, working with industry standard programming paradigms and improving my analytical and problem solving skills, including testing and debugging.

            In terms of soft skills, I’d like to improve my ability to work within a team and better my communication as well as my leadership skills.

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="question4">
          <!-- Question -->
          <h2>What do you expect to be your biggest challenge during the internship?</h2>
          <!-- Answer -->
          <p>
           Getting a good night’s sleep! I am a part of Mount Douglas Secondary’s Yearbook staff as well as the senior Jazz Band and Environmental leadership. Balancing this internship with my other activities will be a bit of a challenge, but it will help me develop my time management skills and prepare me for University life.

        <div class="question5">
          <!-- Question -->
          <h2>If you aren't successful with your application, what steps will you take to help ensure you are successful in the future?</h2>
          <!-- Answer -->
          <p>
           If I am not accepted, I will seek feedback on my application, and strive to strengthen my weakest areas, so that the next time an opportunity of this calibre comes around, I will be ready to take it on.
          </p>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="question6">
          <!-- Question -->
          <h2>What is your favourite thing about programming?</h2>
          <!-- Answer -->
          <p>
           I enjoy all aspects of software development, starting with figuring out the requirements all the way to testing and debugging. Although the latter occasionally gives me grief, it is still an important part of programming, because it requires the use of problem solving skills. My favorite part is program design, because it allows me to flex my creative muscles.

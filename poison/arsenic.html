				<h3>Properties and Uses</h3>
				<p>
					Arsenic is considered a heavy metal, with an atomic mass of 74.9 amu. Unlike other members of the metalloid group, arsenic has two solid forms: a reactive, unstable, waxy yellow nonmetal, and a stable, steel-gray, brittle metal, which is the more common form. Although gray arsenic remains stable in both water and dry air, it will tarnish in the presence of moist air, oxidizing to form arsenic trioxide (AsO<sub>3</sub>). Arsenic has no liquid form, and sublimes directly into a gas at 613 <sup>o</sup>C, where it reacts with the air to form arsenic oxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). <br><br>

					Uses for this element include wood preservation and the manufacture of special glass. In very low doses, arsenic is an essential part of the diet. It is consumed through seafood, rice, mushrooms and poultry, whose feed is sprinkled with arsenic to improve weight gain and meat yield.

					<h3>Causes and symptoms of poisoning</h3>
					Victims often come in contact with arsenic through contaminated groundwater from the Earth’s crust or more commonly, through runoff waste from industrial plants. Other forms of contact include smoking tobacco and eating food with high arsenic levels, such as large fish whose arsenic levels rise through bioaccumulation.<br><br>
					Early poisoning symptoms include swollen skin, acute vomiting, chronic brain degeneration and diarrhea accompanied by blood. According to the World Health Organization, symptoms of long term arsenic poisoning first make themselves known in the skin, in the form of hyperpigmentation and skin cancer.
					Cancer also occurs in the major organs, such as the kidneys and the liver. Other symptoms include numbness and heart disease.

					Calcium arsenate (Ca<sub>3</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and lead (II) hydrogen arsenate (PbHArO<sub>4</sub>), are the compounds of choice when it comes to poisoning. This because they are both soluble in water,and more importantly, arsenate (AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3-</sup> is an analog of phosphate(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3-</sup>, which allows it to disrupt cellular processes essential for life, such as <a href="glycolysis.html" class="all"><b>glycolysis</b></a>.

			<h3>How does Arsenic infiltrate the body?</h3>
				
			<p>
				Although <a href="glycolysis.html" class="all">glycolysis</a> is described as being a closed system, this is not the case in practice. Substrates produced by other cells can enter <a href="glycolysis.html">glycolysis</a> at any step.
				For example, glucose-6 phosphate formed from breaking down food can enter the <a href="glycolysis.html" class="all">glycolysis</a> equation of a cell during the 2nd step (isomerase). Other sugars, such as monosaccharides can also enter the process at any point, but the type of sugar will affect the net ATP produced during the <a href="glycolysis.html" class="all">glycolysis</a>.<br><br>

				As mentioned previously, arsenate is an analog to phosphate. When arsenates infiltrate the body, during the 6th step (hydrogenase) they can replace the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group, forming 1-Arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead of 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate. This unstable molecule hydrolyzes immediately to form 3-phosphoglycerate, skipping the energy releasing step. Thus, the ATP molecule created in this step never appears, and <a href="glycolysis.html"class="all">glycolysis</a> is uncoupled, leading to a deficit in ATP and therefore, the disruption of other life processes.

			<p><h3>Giulina Tofana</h3>
				Guilia Tofana was a Palermitian noblewoman who specialized in the art of poisoning. As a young girl, she spent a large chunk of her time in apothecary shops, watching them create solutions used for healing. Eventually, she was able to create her own, dubbed Aqua Tofana, which contained lead, belladonna, and most importantly: arsenic. The poison was sold to women wishing to escape their abusive husbands. As a result, she became known as “the friend of the weary wife” and gained numerous customers from all over Italy. A single dose of it caused cold-like symptoms. The second dose accentuated the victim's weakness by inducing lethargy. The third dose would result in vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, and a burning sensation in the digestive system. The fourth and final dose would result in death, which was long and drawn out, giving the victim enough time to pen out a will. About 600 men met their ends in this way, according to testimonies from Giuliana and her daughter Girolama Spera after they were ratted out to the papal authorities.

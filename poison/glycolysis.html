	<h1>Glycolysis</h1>
	<p>

		<div  class="text">Glycolysis is the process in which a glucose molecule is converted to pyruvates to be used and released as energy. It takes place in the cytosol of the cell. The glucose molecule reacts with two ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) molecules and 2 Phosphate groups to form two pyruvate molecules, 2 NADH and a net total of 2ATP:<br><br>


			C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 2 ADP + 2 [P]i + 2 NAD<sup>+</sup> --> 2 pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH <br><br>

		This process is considered to be one of, if not the most important cellular reaction because it produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which are both essential for carrying out life processes: ATP allows cells to store energy, and NADH has the potential to create more ATP molecules. The first five steps are responsible for converting the 6-carbon sugar to two 3-three-Carbon sugars(glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate). The first and third consume the two ATP molecules using a kinase enzyme. The next five are responsible for energy production, and are repeated for each glyceraldehyde-3 Phosphate. In reactions 7 and 10, one ATP molecule is produced per glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate. The steps of glycolysis go as follows. <br><br>
</div><br>	
		<div class="text">
			<b>First step</b><br>
			A kinase reaction adds one of the ATP's phosphates to the end of the glucose. The products glucose-6 phosphate, ADP and a hydrogen ion:<br>

			Glucose + ATP<sup>4−</sup> → Glucose-6-phosphate<sup>2−</sup> + ADP<sup>3−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
		</div><br>
		<div  class="text">
		 <b>Second step</b><br>

		 An Isomerase (enzyme which facilitates intramolecular rearrangements) reaction converts the previous glucose molecule to fructose-6 phosphate by rearranging the covalent bonds:<br>
			Glucose-6-phosphate<sup>2</sup>− → Fructose-6-phosphate<sup>2−</sup>

		 </div> <br>
		 <div  class="text"><b>Third step</b><br> A phosphate is taken from one of the pre-existing ATP molecules and attached to the fructose-6 phosphate through another kinase reaction. This forms fructose 1,6 bisphosphate:<br>
			 Fructose-6-phosphate<sup>2−</sup> + ATP<sup>4−</sup> → Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate<sup>4−</sup> + ADP<sup>3−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup></div> <br>
		

		<div  class="text"><b>Fourth step</b><br> A lyase reaction splits the fructose 1,6 bisphosphate into two 3-Carbon molecules: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3 Phosphate:<br>
			Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate<sup>4−</sup> → Dihydroxyacetone phosphate<sup>2−</sup> + Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate<sup>2−</sup></div>  <br>

		<div  class="text"><b>Fifth step</b><br> The Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is rearranged in another isomerase reaction, giving way to another  glyceraldehyde-3 Phosphate:<br>
			Dihydroxyacetone phosphate<sup>2−</sup> → Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate<sup>2−</sup></div><br>

		<div  class="text">
		<b>Sixth step</b><br>
		Via another hydrogenase reaction, the glyceraldehyde-3 Phosphate is oxidized to form 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.This reaction also produces 2 NADH molecules which are later used to produce more ATP: 
	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate<sup>2−</sup> + Pi<sup>2−</sup> + NAD<sup>+</sup>→ 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate<sup>4−</sup> + NADH + H<sup>+</sup></div><br> 

		<div  class="text"><b>Seventh step</b><br> One of 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate’s phosphatase is transferred to an ADP molecule, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate in a kinase reaction:<br>
		1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate<sup>4−</sup> + ADP<sup>3−</sup> → 3-Phosphoglycerate<sup>3−</sup> + ATP<sup>4−</sup></div><br>

		<div  class="text"><b>Eigth step</b><br>A mutase reaction shifts the Phosphate of the 3rd carbon to the second Carbon on the 3-phosphoglycerate, forming 2-phosphoglycerate:<br>
		3-Phosphoglycerate<sup>3−</sup> → 2-Phosphoglycerate<sup>3−</sup></div><br> <div  class="text">	<b>Ninth step</b><br> Another lyase reaction removes water to form phosphoenolpyruvate:<br>
	2-Phosphoglycerate<sup>3−</sup> → Phosphoenolpyruvate<sup>3−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O</div><br><div  class="text"> <b>Tenth step</b><br>The phosphate is removed and donated to ADP, forming pyruvate and another ATP:<br>
		Phosphoenolpyruvate<sup>3−</sup> + ADP<sup>3−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> → Pyruvate<sup>−</sup> + ATP<sup>4−</sup></div><br>

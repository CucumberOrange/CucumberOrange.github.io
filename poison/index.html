					Arsenic is considered a heavy metal, with an atomic mass of 74.9 amu. Unlike other members of the metalloid group, Arsenic has two solid forms: a reactive, unstable yellow nonmetal, and a steel-gray brittle metal, the more common form. Although gray Arsenic remains stable in both water and dry air, it will tarnish in the presence of moist air, oxidizing to form Arsenic Trioxide. Arsenic has no liquid form, and sublimes directly into a gas at 613 <sup>o</sup>C, where it reacts with the air to form Arsenous Oxide.

					Uses for this element include wood preservation and the manufacture of special glass. In very low doses, Arsenic is an essential part of the diet, which is taken in through consumption of seafood, rice, mushrooms and even poultry, whose feed is sprinkled with Arsenic to improve weight gain and meat yield.

					Most victims come in contact with this poisonous element through groundwater contaminated by Arsenic in the Earth’s mantle or more commonly, runoff waste from industrial plants. Other causes include smoking tobacco and eating food with high Arsenic levels, such as large fish whose Arsenic levels rise through bioaccumulation.
					Early symptoms include swollen skin, acute vomiting, chronic brain degeneration and diarrhea accompanied by blood. According to the World Health Organization, symptoms of long term Arsenic poisoning first make themselves known in the skin, in the form of hyperpigmentation and even skin cancer, as this element is considered to be a carcinogen. 
					Cancer also occurs in the major organs, such as the kidneys and the liver. Other symptoms include numbness, heart disease and death.

					Calcium Arsenate (Ca<sub>3</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and Lead (II) Hydrogen Arsenate (PbHArO<sub>4</sub>), are the compounds of choice when it comes to poisoning, because they are both soluble in water, and more importantly, Arsenate (AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3-</sup>is an analog of Phosphate(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3-</sup>, which allows it to disrupt cellular processes essential for life, such as <a href="glycolysis.html">Glycolysis.</a>.

			<h3>How does Arsenic affect the body?</h3>
			<div class="text">
			<p>
				Although the description of the process has been described as a closed system, this is not the case in practice. Substrates produced by other cells can enter glycolysis at any step.
				For example, glucose-6 phosphate formed from breaking down food can enter the glycolysis equation of a cell during the 2nd step. Other sugars, such as monosaccharides can also enter the process at any point, and the type of sugar will affect the net ATP produced during the glycolysis equation.

				As mentioned previously, Arsenate is the analog to Phosphate. When Arsenates infiltrate the body, during the 6th step they can replace the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group, forming 1-Arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead of 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate. This unstable molecule hydrolyzes immediately to form 3-phosphoglycerate, skipping the energy releasing step. Thus, the ATP molecule created in this step never happens, and glycolysis is uncoupled, leading to a deficit in ATP and therefore, the disruption of other life processes.

			<p> Guilia Tofana was a Palermtian noblewoman who specialized in the art of poisoning. As a young girl, she spent a large chunk of her time in apothecary shops, watching them create solutions used for healing. Eventually, she was able to create her own, dubbed aqua Tofana, which contained Lead, belladonna, and most importantly:Arsenic. The poison was often sold to women wishing to escape their abusive husbands. As a result, she became known as “the friend of the weary wife” and gained numerous customers from all over Italy. A single dose of it caused cold-like symptoms. The third dose would result in vomiting , dehydration, diarrhea, and a burning sensation in the digestive system. The final dose would result in death, which was long and drawn out, giving the victim enough time to pen out a will. About 600 men met their ends in this way, according to testimonies from Giuliana and her daughter Girolama Spera after they were ratted out to the papal authorities.

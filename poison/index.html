		<h1>The Toxicology of Arsenic, Thallium and Mercury</h1>
		<div  class="text">
			<p>What do Iraqi farmers, the anti-colonialist leader of Cameroon and 600 Renaissance era men have in common? They all fell victim to poisonous elements. It is known that some elements, when consumed in large quantities, have the capacity to kill. However, the way these elements infiltrate the inner workings of the human body is not commonly known. The three elements studied in this project are arsenic, a metalloid, thallium, a transition metal and mercury, a post-transition metal.<br><br> 

			The objective of this project is to determine why these elements are poisonous by comparing their physical and chemical properties, studying how these elements disrupt the body's working order  at the molecular level and noting how the body reacts to these disruptions.

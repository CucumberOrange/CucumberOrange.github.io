            Arsenic is considered a heavy metal, with an atomic mass of 74.9 amu. Unlike other members of the metalloid group, Arsenic has two solid forms: a reactive, unstable yellow nonmetal, and a steel-gray brittle metal, the more common form. Although gray Arsenic remains stable in both water and dry air, it will tarnish in the presence of moist air, oxidizing to form Arsenic Trioxide. Arsenic has no liquid form, and sublimes directly into a gas at 613 oC, where it reacts with the air to form Arsenous Oxide.

            Uses for this element include wood preservation and the manufacture of special glass. In very low doses, Arsenic is an essential part of the diet, which is taken in through consumption of seafood, rice, mushrooms and even poultry, whose feed is sprinkled with Arsenic to improve weight gain and meat yield.

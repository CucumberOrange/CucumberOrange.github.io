					On August 14 1996, at Dartmouth University, heavy metals specialist Karen Wetterhahn was studying the reactions between heavy metal ions and DNA repair proteins. While experiementing, a couple drops of the toxic element fell out of the tip of the pipette and onto her latex gloved hand. Although she followed proper cleanup procedures at the time, she was unaware of the element's potent ability to eat away at latex gloves and worse, her skin. Two weeks following this incident, she was dead. The element? mercury, also known as liquid silver.

				<h3>Properties and Uses</h3>
				<p>
					Mercury is considered to be a heavy metal with a mass of 200.6 amu. It is capable of forming bonds with other transition metals, such as gold, silver, ainc, aluminum, manganese and copper to form amalgams, which are commonly used in dentistry as fillings. At high temperatures, Mercury will react with acids and oxygen in the air. Like other transition metals, mercury has two ions: the highly toxic Hg<sup>+</sup>, and the less toxic Hg<sup>2+</sup>.

					The most well known use for mercury is the red fluid in a thermometer, barometers and other laboratory devices. Mercury cells are used in the manufacture of batteries and other electrical apparatuses.  In prehistoric times, cinnabar (HgS) was used for cave paintings due to its bright red colour. In ancient China, it was rumoured that mercury could be used as an elixir for immortality, which led to the deaths of multiple emperors.

				<h3>Causes and symptoms of poisoning</h3>
				<p>	
					Mercury, when ingested, collects in the brain and disrupts neurotransmitters. This can result in anxiety, depression, extreme anger from out of seemingly nowhere, irritability and headaches. Long term symptoms of Mercury poisoning include muscle tremors, hallucinations, lack of motor skills and vomiting.

				<h3>How does mercury affect the body?</h3>
			<p>
				Most Methylmercury is ingested through the consumption of large saltwater fish, such as tuna and swordfish. When Mercury enters the aquatic ecosystem, it is consumed by and bioaccumulates in small fish. When the fry are consumed by larger fish, the Mercury is also consumed and intensifies in accumulation. When ingested in large quantities, MethylMercury can cause a variety of problems, such as visual impairment, speech impairments, deafness, ataxia, lack of limb coordination and trouble walking. These symptoms, especially if they occur in children and infants are usually permanent with no cure. The gastrointestinal tract absorbs about 95% of the ingested CH<sub>3</sub>Hg; when it is inhaled, 80% is retained. In the bloodstream, MeHg couples with sulfhydryl groups such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting their ability to produce antioxidants. As a result, the body goes into <a class="all" href="oxstress.html"><b>Oxidative Stress.</b></a><br><br>

				Elemental mercury at room temperature poses a minimal threat, as the body poorly absorbs it. Mercury vapours on the other hand enter the body through the lungs, and due to their solubility are capable of passing through cell membranes and wreaking havoc in the kidneys and  nervous system. Upon entering the bloodstream, the catalase enzyme oxidises elemental mercury to its Hg<sup>2+</sup>ion. Although the mercury has less of a chance to traverse the Blood-Brain-Barrier, like MeHg,  the Hg<sup>2+</sup> ion is now capable of reacting with enzymes, antioxidants such as glutathione, and ion channels, disrupting cellular processes and detoxification processes.

				<h3>1971 Iraq grain poisoning</h3>
			<p> 
				In 1971, the Arabian Peninsula was struck by a crippling drought, pushing farmers, who made up a large chunk of the population to the brink of famine. Iraq’s grain farmers got hit especially hard. As a result, the Iraqi government decided to look to the international stage as a means to feed their people.  After negotiations, Iraq prepared to receive a shipment of Mexipak: a type of wheat with a higher yield which was suitable to Iraq’s climate. The 100,000 ton shipment was to come in between October and November, or when planting season occurred. However, Iraqi specialists worried that the seeds would germinate while in transit, so the wheat was coated in methylmercury, which at the time was used as a fungicide and did not contaminate plants after they were planted. Although the sacks had instructions warning against the consumption of the grain until it was planted, these instructions were in English and Spanish. Also, due to technical problems the grain arrived in Iraq far too late for the planting season, leaving many hungry farmers with useless grain they could neither eat nor plant. Against government warnings regarding the grain’s toxicity, farmers washed off the pinkish-orange dye the wheat had been dipped in, and ground it into bread. For a couple of weeks, there were no major consequences. However, Iraqi hospitals became overrun by individuals who were complaining of ill mental health. Hundreds died, with an estimated toll of 459 citizens. After linking the poisoning disaster to the methylmercury laced grain, the government tried to salvage as much of it as possible, but a good chunk of it was dumped in lakes and rivers by farmers, contaminating aquatic life and leading to an environmental disaster.

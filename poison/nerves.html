	<h1>Nerve Impulses</h1>
	<div>
	<p class="text">Nerve impulses are electrical signals that are used as a method of communication  between neurons. They are the result of a difference in electric charge across a neuron’s plasma membrane. When a neuron is not transmitting signals, it is in resting position, and its overall charge is neutral. This is maintained by the Sodium-Potassium pump, which pumps Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the neuron, and K<sup>+</sup> ions into the neuron using energy stored. The neuron thus, has an overall neutral charge. <br><br> A neuron is jolted into action position by a chemical signal from another neuron. This opens the neuron’s Na<sup>+</sup> channels, allowing the previously displaced sodium ions back inside the cell, positively charging the inside. This charge reversal is translated down the neuron’s nerve fibre. When the signal reaches the synaptic cleft, the axon releases molecules of a neurotransmitting chemical, which traverse the cleft and bind the neighbouring neuron’s receptors, setting off another action potential. Nerve impulses act as messages between the various organs of the body and the brain.</p></div>

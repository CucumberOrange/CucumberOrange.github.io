	<h1>Oxidative Stress</h1>
	<div class="text">
	<p>Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants present in the human body. Free radicals are molecules which contain oxygen and have an uneven number of electrons. This allows them to bond easily and react with other molecules, causing both beneficial and fatal reactions. Their role is to fight pathogens. However,  if present in high levels, free radicals can cause various illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes by damaging DNA, proteins and lipids. Antioxidants are molecules which are capable of donating electrons to other molecules without becoming unstable themselves. They help keep the free radicals in balance.

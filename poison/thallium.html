				<p>
					April 10, 1995. In the hospital of China’s prestigious Peking University, a second year student is fighting for her life. Just a year ago, she had been a talented  musician who was well liked by her peers. But that all changed when she started showing mysterious symptoms. These included rapid hair loss and extreme stomach pain. After being hospitalized at the TongRen Hospital, her condition improved and she was allowed to return to school. However, in March of 1995, her previous symptoms returned in increasing strength, only this time accompanied by severe leg pain, partial facial paralysis and loss of muscular eye control. The culprit? A heavy metal so deadly to the human body that it earned the nickname “the poisoner’s poison” - Thallium.

				<h3>Properties and Uses</h3>
				<p>
					At room temperature, thallium is a bluish-white metal which is soft enough to be cut by a knife. Like other transition metals, it reacts violently with acids and oxygen in air. It is multivalent, having a 1+ and 3+ ion.  It is both odourless and tasteless in its pure form, which is why it is an effective poison, capable of being slipped into drinks without drawing the victim’s attention.<br><br>

					Thallium is mostly used in the manufacture of fibre optics and glass lens industries for cameras, as well as parts for other electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops. Previously, thallium (I) sulphate was used as a rodent poison, under the name “Thall-rat,” which in 1950s Australia, gained infamy as a suicide agent. In the 1930’s, thallium solutions were popular hair loss tonics due to their ability to disrupt hair keratin positions.

				<h3>Causes and symptoms of poisoning</h3>
				<p>	
					Thallium enters the human body through contaminated food and drinking water. It navigates the body via the bloodstream, and collects in the major organs, such as the kidneys, heart, lungs and brain. Early symptoms include intense stomach pain accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, sudden hair loss, sudden weight loss, lethargy and a variety of problems attributed to the nervous system. These include gradual numbness, tickling sensations in the palms and feet and peripheral nerve damage.

				<h3>How does thallium infiltrate the body?</h3>
			<p>
				The compound most likely used for poison is thallium (I) sulphate (TlSO<sub>4</sub>), which is toxic because of the Tl<sup>+</sup> ion in the compound. When a Tl<sup>+</sup> ion enters a cell, it disrupts many cellular processes which rely on the transportation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. This is because it mimicks the behaviour of these ions and can substitute itself into the transportation pathways, which results in damage to <a href="nerves.html" class="all"><b>nerve impulses.</b></a> When nerve impulses are damaged, the line of communication between the brain and body is effectively broken, resulting in motor and sensory problems, such as the "walking on fire" sensation.<br><br>Thallium is also capable of bonding to sulfhydryl groups in hair keratin, which shifts the position of the hair follicles. As a result, the follicles atrophy and hair production grinds to a halt. At least 100 strands are lost every day.

				<h3>The poisoning of Zhu Ling</h3>
			<p> In 1994, on the campus of the Tsinghua University a student by the name of Zhu Ling began showing mysterious symptoms. These included rapid hair loss and extreme stomach pain. After being hospitalized at the TongRen Hospital, her condition improved and she was allowed to return to school. However, in March of 1995, her previous symptoms returned in increasing strength, only this time accompanied by severe leg pain, partial facial paralysis and loss of muscular eye control. After being hospitalized once more, this time at Peking Union Medical Hospital, one of her physicians suspected thallium poisoning, as Zhu Ling’s symptoms matched those of a patient he had diagnosed in the 1960s. However, the student reported having no contact with thallium whatsoever, and the Tsinghua Chemistry department confirmed this. As a result, she was misdiagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome, and her condition only continued to deteriorate.<br><br> On April 10, 1995, Zhu Ling’s two friends Cai Quan Xing and Bei Zhicheng grew weary and frustrated with the physicians’ actions in treating Zhu Ling. They sent out a SOS letter on the Internet to many early social groups, in what is considered to be a milestone in Internet diagnosis as close to 1,500 responses were recieved. This was a miracle considering the lack of Internet connectivity in institutions of higher education, especially in China. Out of the responses from Western toxicologists, about a third suggested that their friend was a victim of thallium poisoning. By the time Prussian Blue was administered to Zhu Ling, the thallium had been in her system for roughly 4 months. From the May of 1995 to January 2006, the police investigated the case and finally singled out a suspect: Sun Wei, a well-off student who supposedly held a grudge against her talented classmate. She was only person who had a close relationship with Zhu Ling who had access to poisonous elements as she was a science student.

				<h3>Are there any cures?</h3>

			<p> The most common cure for thallium poisoning is potassium ferric hexacyanoferrate (K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]), or as it is known in the art world, “Prussian Blue.”<br><br> Prussian Blue first traps the thallium compound in the intestine. Then, it exchanges its K<sup>+</sup> ion for the Tl<sup>+</sup> ion, resulting in two insoluble compounds which are disposed of via excrement. It is recommended that the antidote be consumed by the victim until the mass of thallium in their urine drops below 0.5 mg. Ironically, the cure to the “poisoner’s poison” contains cyanide, which on its own is a deadly poison.
